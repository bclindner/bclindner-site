# bclindner.com unfinished site design, 2017

This is an old unfinished site design I had scrapped. It was going to serve as a portfolio site and a custom blog that I could manage through my own admin page, but I decided the work necessary to design, develop, and maintain this would be more trouble than it's worth. The site is semi-functional, but I wouldn't deploy it to production as it is. While not the most complete work, I figured I'd make this public for the sake of showing my experience with the technologies on display here.

The site is a Dockerized node.js app with an nginx proxy which I'd for security, caching, SSL, etc., as well as a Postgres database being manipulated with [Sequelize](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize) to handle blog content and other things. The site uses [pug](https://pugjs.org/) for HTML templating and [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) as a CSS preprocessor. There are plenty of other techologies I had used here - perhaps too many to list, and far too many to remember, hence the project's status - so do some poking around if you're curious.
